## How to Use

### Option 1: Open Directly in Browser

1. Navigate to the `visualizer` directory
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. The visualizer will automatically load data from `../processed_data/summary_statistics.json`

### Option 2: Using a Local Server (Recommended)

For better compatibility and to avoid CORS issues:

```bash
# From the project root directory
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Then open in browser:
# http://localhost:8000/visualizer/
```

Or using Node.js:

```bash
npx serve .
```

## Data Source

The visualizer reads from:
- `processed_data/summary_statistics.json` - Main statistics and aggregated data

This data is generated by the consolidation scripts in the main project.
